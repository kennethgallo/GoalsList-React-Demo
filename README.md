# GoalsList-React-Demo
A simple React web app for adding goals to a list.

If you'd like to run this app yourself, simply clone the repo and open the project folders in your local IDE, such as VS Code.
Make sure you have NPM and Node installed. While in the project directory, initiate the React server by running `npm start` in the command line.

The app should open locally, running on port 3000 (this could be different if your system settings are configured differently for the port number).
